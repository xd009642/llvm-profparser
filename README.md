This is a reasonably complete to parse the llvm instrumentation profraw file
format and avoid the need to install and use the llvm-profdata/llvm-cov
binaries. It aims to be backwards compatible with as many llvm versions that
could be used for coverage data in Rust projects and currently supports the
following llvm versions: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. 

**This project is not affilated with the llvm-project in anyway!** It is merely
a parser for some of their file formats to aid interoperability in Rust.

## Contributing

All of the functionality required has been implemented, however there are areas
to improve in handling unexpected or invalid files. To start fining issues
there's a fuzz directory which will undoubtedly reveal some issues that can be
fixed. Go into the fuzz directory for guides on how to run.
